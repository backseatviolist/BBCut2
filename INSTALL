To install, copy this directory into Platform.userExtensionDir. sc3-plugins is required for the ugens `AutoTrack` and `AnalyseEvents2`.

The main help page is the file BBCut2Wiki.help.rtf. Explore the help files by clicking and trying examples.

Optionally, you can also copy the sound files in sounds/ to the sounds directory in Platform.resourceDir.

== Using both bbcut1 and 2 ==

If you already have bbcut1 you can use both bbcut and bbcut2 on one machine, but must avoid a few class duplications:

remove the bbcutprocs folder from the bbcut1 classes folder. 
remove the DDSlider.sc file from the UI subfolder of part of the bbcut1 classes folder. 

There are new help files for each cut procedure for the bbcut2 way of doing things. If you decide to have this new help for these cut procedures you must discard the 'bbcutproc helpfiles' folder from bbcut1's help system. 

== bbcut2 and Linux ==

The standard classes should work. Your problem are the .scx plugins, ie you don't get the machine listening stuff. A future solution may be found, plugin source code should be released eventually.
